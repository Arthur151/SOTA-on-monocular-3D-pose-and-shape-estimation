# 3DPW dataset

The "3D Poses in the Wild dataset" is the first dataset in the wild with accurate 3D poses for evaluation. While other datasets outdoors exist, they are all restricted to a small recording volume. 3DPW is the first one that includes video footage taken from a moving phone camera.

The dataset includes:

1. 60 video sequences.
2. 2D pose annotations.
3. 3D poses obtained with our method. Our method leverages video and IMU and the poses are very accurate despite the complexity of the scenes.
4. Camera poses for every frame in the sequences.
5. 3D body scans and 3D people models (re-poseable and re-shapeable). Each sequence contains its corresponding models.
6. 18 3D models in different clothing variations.
